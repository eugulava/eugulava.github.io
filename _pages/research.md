**Horizon-based Estimation of Volatility Models: Application to Specification Testing and Forecasting** (2023)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Multi-period volatility forecasting of cumulative returns is crucial for financial decision-making. However, misspecified models can lead to inaccurate forecasts, as standard parameter estimation methods, such as quasi-maximum likelihood, may not align with the forecasting objective. To reduce the impact of model misspecification, we propose estimating parameters of GARCH- and RV-type models using a QLIKE loss function tailored to multi-period volatility, ensuring that estimation and evaluation loss functions are aligned. Since both estimators are consistent for the true parameter vector when the model is correctly specified, we develop a misspecification test based on the Hausman principle, which compares two estimatorsâ€”one of which is efficient but not robust to the forecasting objective. In a Monte Carlo study, we examine misspecification with respect to long memory dynamics. Our results show that the specification test is correctly sized and has power that increases with the degree of long memory misspecification. Additionally, we recover multi-period volatility forecasts and find that when the null hypothesis of correct specification is not rejected, both estimators perform equivalently; however, when rejected, our estimator demonstrates improved forecast accuracy. In an out-of-sample analysis of ten return and realised measure series from 2001 to 2010, we demonstrate the empirical usefulness of our estimator particularly for less complex (more misspecified) models, which highlights that the performance of our estimator depends on the bias-variance trade-off.

**Long Memory Realised GAS Model** (2022)

<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>
We introduce a univariate score-driven model that explicitly incorporates long-memory dynamics in the conditional variance of daily returns. We model the conditional variance both as a fractionally integrated process and as a heterogeneous autoregressive model. The new model accommodates heavy-tailed densities for both daily returns and realized measures. This choice of observational densities ensures automatic correction for influential observations through the score function. Our out-of-sample analysis identifies that accounting for long memory is particularly useful for volatility level evaluation and return risk assessment during non-crisis periods.

**Simulation-based Method for Quantiles of Cumulative Variables** (2024) 

<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>
We propose a simulation-based method for constructing conditional quantiles of cumulative variables of interest (e.g., returns, GDP) based on a finite set of one-step-ahead estimated conditional quantiles. We show that the cumulative quantile generated by our method minimises the expected value of the quantile tick-loss function specified with respect to the cumulative variable. Our approach has applications in constructing downside measures of risk, such as Value-at-Risk for cumulative returns and Growth-at-Risk for cumulative GDP growth.
